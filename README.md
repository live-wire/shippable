Node JS application to track issues

Install NodeJS and npm from Node's official website.

run the server as:

#$node asyncAttempt.js 




the UI can be accessed at:
#http://localhost:3000/

Enter the URL of the repo in the text box and click anywhere when ready.



note - app.js has a synchronized implementation. Use asyncAttempt.js for a faster async experience.


If for some reason this app doesn't do what it is supposed to, just update the access-token in asyncAttempt.js
(This access token authorizes our requests to the git-API and it has a short expiry period).
